# Project Origin

Project Origin is an Energinet prototype-project with the goal of providing a way to prove the origin of consumed electricity. It uses the same resolution as the electricity market, currently hourly, instead of the yearly resolution used by the current Guarantee of Origin system (GO), hence we call it Granular Guarantee of Origin (GGO).

The active prototype is currently scheduled to run until November 2020, where the goal is to learn and further develop the prototype, and to harvest all the learned experiences into a possibly future production-ready solution. We welcome as many participants and as much feedback as possible, and will do our best to incorporate feedback into improving the prototype as fast as possible.

Key features of the prototype include:

- Issuing of GGOs based on actual energy production
- Setting up transfer agreements to [continuously] transfer issued GGOs to trading partners
- Retiring of GGOs to prove the origin of consumed electricity
- Generating environmental declaration based on retired GGOs, including detailed emission data and source technologies
- Onboarding users via Eloverblik.dk to access their actual measurement data
- Using a blockchain as ledger for public verifying data

## Cooperation
 
This project is open-source, and our wish is for everyone interested to be part of the project and platform.

You are also welcome to fork it and use it for your own purposes, but we would hope you want to be a part of a common platform.
